## Note
At the moment script does not support the new reddit design.<br>
I'll implement that as soon as I have some spare time.

**Use the old design for now.** To switch to the old design, prefix the reddit domain in the page URL with subdomain **old** as follows: https://old.reddit.com/r/subreddit

## Introduction
To be successfully getting your posts viral on Reddit, you need to posess something more than just the original and quality content.

That is the knowlege about peak user activity times.
        
This reddit monitor keeps track of the activity of a subreddit of your choice. Collected data can be viewed as a graph on [PLOT.LY](http://plot.ly) or exported in CSV format.

### Example Program Output
Here is a graph of /r/worldnews/ activity for April 12, 2018:

## Installation
First install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your browser.
You can also use other user script managers if you'd like. [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) would do it.

Then intstall the script from:
* [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/ru/scripts/40775-ucsx-reddit-monitor-graph-followers-activity-of-a-subreddit)
* [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/arcan770077f/[UCSX_Reddit_Monitor]_Graph_Followers_Activity_Of_A_Subreddit).
* Or [install now with one click](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkadyt/_UCSX_Reddit_Monitor_/master/script.user.js).

## Usage
After you've installed the userscript, visit the subreddit that you would like to monitor. Make sure that your userscript manager is enabled and this script is installed.

You will see a small brown panel down the screen:

Click on the `START SCRIPT` button to launch monitoring.

Once you are done monitoring, click on the `EXPORT CSV` to export data in CSV format or `VIEW GRAPH ON PLOT.LY` to view the graph immediately. 

`**WARNING** do not refresh page or navigate anywhere while this script is running. Doing so will result in data loss.`

You will be prompted with this message if you accidentally navigate out.
